# proof of concept using esp32_smartdisplay library

this seemed like a good idea at first since it was the most though through at first glance

it produces huge firmware files though, which makes it kind of unusable at 99.4% of storage used with no own code at all and most of the LVGL code not even enabled

# TODO
- implement some layout on my own
- display some data on the screen
